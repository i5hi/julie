Easiest way to contribute is to add utility functions in src/lib that wrap up common tasks into String interfaces.

All new functions must have unit tests. 

If you are writing a collection of functions to be used together, create a `composite` test that simulates a use-case and tests multiple functions.

Write tests that can be run independently. 

If your test mutates global state, make sure to create helper functions that you can run to clean up any artifacts.
